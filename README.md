# Barista

**Barista** is a tool and substancial collection for leveraging the power of
Unicode and [espanso].

Its current state is very much geared towards my personal setup, but this
may be expanded in the future.

## Triggers

The main advantage of `barista` is that it implements `pretrigger`s and `posttrigger`s programmatically.

Currently:

| Category      | Pretrigger | Posttrigger |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Greek letters | `;`        | None        |
| Digraphs      | `,`        | ` `         |
| General       | `:`        | ` `         |
